# Hi there, :wave:
My name is Maria and I am a software engineer pursuing a master's degree in Technology Entrepreneurship and Innovations in IT. I am also a passionate software engineer with a keen interest in a variety of programming languages such as Java, Angular, JavaScript, Go, and Kubernetes. As someone who is always eager to learn and expand my skills, I find GitHub to be an excellent platform for collaborating with other developers and contributing to open-source projects.
